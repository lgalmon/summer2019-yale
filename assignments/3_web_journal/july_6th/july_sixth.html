      So, I am extremely busy this summer.<br>
      I have to take a summer class to finish up this stupid degree.<br>
      Keep in mind it's taken me nine semesters (4.5 years) and three summers of classes.<br>
      So ya boy is tired.<br><br>
      Not only that, I also work. Last month it was full time.<br>
      This month it's Thursdays and Fridays.<br>
      Except the last two weeks of July when I will also be working Tuesdays.<br><br>
      Lastly, I've been blessed with a show.<br>
      So I've been painting outside of all of this.<br>

        I paint portraits...for the most part.<br>
        So that's what I did today.<br>
