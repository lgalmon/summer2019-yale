      Today was pretty chill. All I did was paint and check the mail for a friend.<br>
      Btw, this is where I currently do my painting.<br>
      I have befriended many spiders.<br>

      I'm subletting right now. And they told me not to get paint on anything.<br>
      Hence, the basement.<br>
      But all is well, because next month I'll have an actual studio space.<br><br>
      I painted all day today, except when I went checked the mail for the friend I am subletting from.<br>
