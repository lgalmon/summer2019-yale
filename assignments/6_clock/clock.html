          The thing with reflecting is that our memory is unreliable. We change things, reinterpret things and forget whole parts of what had happedened. Keep that in mind as you explore this piece.

              Inspired by Judy Chicago's "Autobiography of a Year", this piece aims in part to document six years of my life in colors. Unlike Judy Chicago, who used her colors to make paintings and drawings, I arrange them in a framework that references the grid. Each block of color represents a specific period or moment. The years are divided into six rows. And the colums within those rows correspond to moments and eras within each year. And each row within an "era" corresponds to a particular emotion.

                New Orleans College Prep. (College Prep) New Orleans Center for Creative Arts. (NOCCA)<br> <p>Senior year of high school. I started two new schools, after having been at one the precious three years. At both schools I felt out of place, being one of the few new seniors. But I was happy. I was excited to learn art at NOCCA and excited to apply/ prepare for college at College Prep.</p>

                School was going well. I love novelty and everything was new. I was meeting people and learning new things. At NOCCA especially I began to feel growth. It was my first introduction to thinking about art as a means of communication. Before this art was all about technique. I wanted to improve my skills. It was here, though, that I began to try so say things visually.

                I was among beasts and feeling pretty insecure about my own image-making skills. I was learning a shit ton, mostly from my peers. It was cool to see the variety of visual expressions they had to offer. The worl of art was opening.

                This was still a happy time. But it was also when I first started to feel out of place among white people. I didn't notice then. People were still very novel. But those little moments of hurt years later I would be able to name as micro-agressions. Even later I would become too tired of them to deal.
