    <p>The apartment was as lively as ever. The Marsh children didn’t know how to be quiet. Too many were too opinionated and would get into heated arguments with each other. “So and so was tripping.” “He was full of shit.” “Damn right I could smell it from here.” It was the younger ones that cussed like it was their job. Karen, their mom, would often hear them. The apartment walls were too thin. She often let it slide though. It would take too many ass-whippings to clean out all their mouths. And it was partly her fault. It wasn’t lost on Karen that she used, useses and will continue to use too much profanity when talking to the kids. The bastards always had something to say back, and her patience always ran out first. You couldn’t outlast seven people.</p>
